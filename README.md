# Machine-performance
 In todayâ€™s manufacturing industry, achieving operational efficiency and maintaining high-quality products are essential for success. However, the vast amount of sensor data and machine status information makes it difficult to manually track performance trends and detect issues. This is where data analysis proves invaluable.
  The manufacturing process data set was gotten from KAGGLE. I transformed the data set using Excel, created visualization using Pivot Table and Pivot Charts. I also used Power BI to visualize the analysis which insights were drawn to enable decision-makers to enhance machine utilization, identify sensor anomalies, and improve quality control measures, ultimately fostering more efficient and dependable manufacturing processes.
